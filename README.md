---

## üöÄ Core Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login system using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-based Access Control**: The UI and API are tailored to four distinct roles:
  - **System Admin**: Full system access, including user and department management.
  - **HR Manager**: Manages employee data, performance, payroll, and manager leave requests.
  - **Manager**: Oversees their specific department's team, manages performance reviews, and approves employee leave.
  - **Employee**: Access to personal data, leave requests, and payslip viewing.

### Key Modules
- **Employee Management**: Full CRUD operations for employee records.
- **Department Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete company departments.
- **Performance Tracking**: Managers can create and update performance reviews for their team.
- **Payroll Management**: Admins/HR can create and process payroll records, and employees can view their payslips.
- **Leave Management**: A hierarchical leave approval system (Employee -> Manager -> HR -> Admin).
- **Job Board**: Admins/HR can post job openings for internal viewing.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Each role gets a tailored dashboard with relevant stats and quick actions.

## üìÅ File Structure Explained

The project is organized into two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`.

### `backend/`
-   `node_modules/`: Stores all backend dependencies.
-   `.env`: Contains environment variables like the database connection string and JWT secret. **(This file is not committed to Git)**.
-   `index.js`: The main entry point for the Express server. It sets up middleware, connects to the database, and defines the API routes.
-   `package.json`: Lists all backend dependencies and scripts.
-   **`config/`**
    -   `db.js`: Contains the logic to connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
-   **`controllers/`**: Holds the business logic for the application. Each file corresponds to a specific data model.
    -   `authController.js`: Handles user registration, login, and profile fetching.
    -   `employeeController.js`: Manages all CRUD operations for employees.
-   **`middleware/`**
    -   `auth.js`: Contains JWT verification and role-based authorization functions to protect API routes.
-   **`models/`**: Defines the Mongoose schemas for each collection in the database.
    -   `User.js`: Schema for user login credentials and roles.
    -   `Employee.js`: Schema for detailed employee information.
-   **`routes/`**: Defines the API endpoints. Each file maps HTTP routes (e.g., `/api/employees`) to the corresponding controller functions.

### `frontend/`
-   `dist/`: Contains the optimized production build files, generated by `npm run build`.
-   `node_modules/`: Stores all frontend dependencies.
-   `public/`: Contains static assets.
    -   `_redirects`: Netlify configuration for handling client-side routing.
-   `index.html`: The main HTML template for the single-page application.
-   `package.json`: Lists all frontend dependencies and scripts (like `dev`, `build`).
-   `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for the Vite development server and build process.
-   `tailwind.config.js` / `postcss.config.js`: Configuration files for Tailwind CSS.
-   **`src/`**: Contains the main React application source code.
    -   `main.jsx`: The entry point of the React app, where the `App` component is rendered to the DOM.
    -   `index.css`: Global stylesheet where Tailwind CSS is imported.
    -   `App.jsx`: The root component that sets up the application's router (`react-router-dom`).
    -   `api.js`: A pre-configured Axios instance for making API calls. It automatically attaches the JWT token to every request.
    -   **`components/`**: Contains all the React components that make up the UI. Each file typically represents a page or a major UI element (e.g., `Login.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`).
    -   **`contexts/`**:
        -   `AuthContext.jsx`: A React Context that manages global user authentication state, making it accessible throughout the application.

## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
-   npm (or yarn)
-   MongoDB (either installed locally or through a service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd tech-solutions-ems
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    -   Open the newly created `backend/.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string and a JWT secret:
        ```env
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
        PORT=5000
        ```

3.  **Seed the Database**
    -   Make sure your MongoDB server is running.
    -   Use a tool like MongoDB Compass or the `mongosh` command-line tool to run the contents of the `db.js` (seeding script) provided in the project files. This will populate your database with initial demo data.

4.  **Setup the Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    ```
    -   The `frontend/.env.local` file should point to your local backend server. The default is usually correct:
        ```env
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
        ```

### Running the Application

You'll need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Run the Backend Server** (from the `backend` directory)
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    -   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server** (from the `frontend` directory)
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    -   The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üö¢ Deployment

-   The **frontend** is deployed on **Netlify**. The `_redirects` file in `frontend/public` is configured to handle client-side routing correctly.
-   The **backend** can be deployed on any service that supports Node.js, such as Render, Heroku, or a VPS. Remember to set the environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`) in your deployment service's configuration.
